📊 Sales Data Analysis (AI-Assisted)
## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end sales data analysis workflow built to transform raw sales data into clean, structured, and insight-ready datasets, followed by exploratory analysis and dashboarding.

A key focus of this project is demonstrating how AI can be used as a productivity tool in modern data analytics — especially for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering — while maintaining analytical control and business understanding.

## Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw sales data using AI-assisted Python workflows

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns

Calculate key sales KPIs such as revenue, growth, and product performance

Build interactive dashboards for business insights

Follow professional project structuring and documentation standards

## Tools & Technologies

Python – data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering

AI tools – assisted in generating cleaning logic and transformation rules

Excel – validation, pivot analysis

Power BI – interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

GitHub – version control and project documentation

## Data Cleaning Approach

Raw data is preserved in its original form

AI is used to assist in identifying cleaning rules, column standardization, and feature creation

Cleaning logic is implemented and validated using Python

All transformations are reproducible through scripts

This approach reflects how data analysts increasingly use AI to reduce manual effort while maintaining data accuracy and transparency.

## Key Analysis Areas

Sales performance over time

Product and category performance

Regional and customer-level trends

Deal size and revenue distribution

Actionable business insights for decision-making

## Outcome

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Work with real-world sales data

Apply AI responsibly in data analytics workflows

Build clean, reproducible data pipelines

Communicate insights through dashboards and documentation
